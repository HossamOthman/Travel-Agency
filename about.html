                    What is Lorem Ipsum?
                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                    industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
                    and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the
                    leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
                    with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
                    publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                <p>When we started in 2003, we set out to do things differently. We wanted to show all flight options in one place, creating a simple alternative to the confusing sites that make travel feel like hard work.</p>
                <p>Fast forward to today and we’ve gone from a flight search engine to a global leader in travel. We're proud that more than 100 million people across the world (that's quite a few!) rely on our app and website each month to help them with their travel plans.

                </p>
                <p>Dedicated to making travel as simple as possible, we help each and every one of them find the best options across flights, hotels and car hire to book the perfect trip.</p>
                <p>And We don't stop anywhere</p>
